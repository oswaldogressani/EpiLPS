Description: This package uses Laplacian-P-splines for estimating the
 instantaneous reproduction number R(t). The Negative Binomial distribution is 
 used to model the time series of incidence counts. Two methods are available
 for fitting R(t): (1) LPSMAP is a fully sampling-free approach based on a 
 maximum a posteriori calibration of the hyperparameter vector and (2) LPSMALA
 is a fully stochastic approach with a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm and
 Langevin diffusions for efficient sampling of the posterior distribution.
