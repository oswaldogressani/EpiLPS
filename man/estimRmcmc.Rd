\title{Estimation of the reproduction number with Laplacian-P-splines via MCMC}
\usage{
estimRmcmc(incidence, si, K = 30, dates = NULL, niter = 5000, burnin = 2000,
 CoriR = FALSE, WTR = FALSE, priors = Rmodelpriors(), progressbar = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence}{A vector containing the incidence time series. If
\code{incidence} contains NA values at certain time points, these are
replaced by the average of the left- and right neighbor counts. If the
right neighbor is NA, the left neighbor is used as a replacement value.}

\item{si}{The (discrete) serial interval distribution.}

\item{K}{Number of B-splines in the basis.}

\item{dates}{A vector of dates in format "YYYY-MM-DD" (optional).}

\item{niter}{The number of MCMC samples.}

\item{burnin}{The burn-in size.}

\item{CoriR}{Should the \eqn{R_t} estimate of Cori (2013) be also computed?}

\item{WTR}{Should the \eqn{R_t} estimate of Wallinga-Teunis (2004) be
also computed?}

\item{priors}{A list containing the prior specification of the model
hyperparameters as set in Rmodelpriors. See ?Rmodelpriors.}

\item{progressbar}{Should a progression bar indicating status of MCMC
algorithm be shown? Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\itemize{
 \item incidence: The incidence time series.
 \item si: The serial interval distribution.
 \item RLPS: A data frame containing estimates of the reproduction number
   obtained with the Laplacian-P-splines methodology.
 \item thetahat: The estimated vector of B-spline coefficients.
 \item Sighat: The estimated variance-covariance matrix of the Laplace

   obtained with the method of Cori (2013).
 \item RWT: A data frame containing the estimates of the reproduction
   obtained with the method of Wallinga-Teunis (2004).
 \item LPS_elapsed: The routine real elapsed time (in seconds) when estimation
   of the reproduction number is carried out with Laplacian-P-splines.
 \item penparam: The estimated penalty parameter related to the P-spline model.
 \item K: The number of B-splines used in the basis.
 \item NegBinoverdisp: The estimated overdispersion parameter of the negative
   binomial distribution for the incidence time series.
 \item optimconverged: Indicates whether the algorithm to maximize the
   posterior distribution of the hyperparameters has converged.
 \item method: The method to estimate the reproduction number with Laplacian-P-splines.
 \item optim_method: The chosen method to to maximize the posterior distribution
   of the hyperparameters.
 \item HPD90_Rt: The \eqn{90\%} HPD interval for Rt obtained with the LPS methodology.
 \item HPD95_Rt: The \eqn{95\%} HPD interval for Rt obtained with the LPS methodology.

\description{
This routine estimates the instantaneous reproduction number \eqn{R_t};
 the mean number of secondary infections generated by an infected individual
 at time \eqn{t} (White et al. 2020); by using Bayesian P-splines and Laplace
 approximations (Gressani et al. 2022). The inference approach is fully
 stochastic with a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm. The
 \code{estimRmcmc()} routine estimates \eqn{R_t} based on a time series of
 incidence counts and a (discretized) serial interval distribution. The
 negative binomial distribution is used to model incidence count data and
 P-splines (Eilers and Marx, 1996) are used to smooth the epidemic curve.
 The link between the epidemic curve and the reproduction number is
 established via the renewal equation.
