\arguments{
\item{incidence}{A vector containing the incidence time series. If \code{incidence}
 contains NA values at certain time points, these are replaced by the average of
the left- and right neighbor counts. If the right neighbor is NA, the left neighbor
is used as a replacement value.}

\item{K}{Number of B-splines in the basis.}

\item{dates}{A vector of dates in format "YYYY-MM-DD" (optional).}

\item{maxmethod}{The method to maximize the hyperparameter posterior distribution.}

\item{CoriR}{Should the \eqn{R_t} estimate of Cori (2013) be also computed?}

\item{WTR}{Should the \eqn{R_t} estimate of Wallinga-Teunis (2004) be also computed?}

\item{optimstep}{Learning rate for the "HillClimb" method to maximize the
posterior distribution of the hyperparameters.}

\item{priors}{A list containing the prior specification of the model
hyperparameters as set in Rmodelpriors. See ?Rmodelpriors.}

\description{
This routine estimates the instantaneous reproduction number \eqn{R_t}; the mean number
of secondary infections generated by an infected individual at time \eqn{t} (White et
al. 2020); by using Bayesian P-splines and Laplace approximations (Gressani et al. 2022).
Estimation of \eqn{R_t} is based on a time series of incidence counts and (a discretized) serial
interval distribution. The negative binomial distribution is used to model incidence
count data and P-splines (Eilers and Marx, 1996) are used to smooth the epidemic curve. The link
between the epidemic curve and the reproduction number is established via the renewal equation.
}
\details{
The \code{estimR} routine estimates the reproduction number in a
 totally "sampling-free" fashion. The hyperparameter vector (containing the
 penalty parameter of the P-spline model and the overdispersion parameter of
 the negative binomial model for the incidence time series) is fixed at its
 maximum a posteriori (MAP). By default, the algorithm for maximization is
 the one of Nelder and Mead (1965). If \code{maxmethod} is set to "HillClimb",
 then a gradient ascent algorithm is used to maximize the hyperparameter posterior.
