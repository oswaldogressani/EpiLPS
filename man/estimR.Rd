\title{Estimation of the reproduction number with Laplacian-P-splines}
\usage{
estimR(incidence, si, K = 30, dates = NULL, CoriR = FALSE, WTR = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence}{A vector containing the time series of incidence counts.}

\item{si}{The discrete serial interval distribution.}

\item{K}{Number of B-splines in the basis.}

\item{dates}{A vector of date values (optional).}

\item{CoriR}{Should the Rt estimate be also computed with the method of Cori?}

\item{WTR}{Should the Rt estimate be also computed with the Wallinga-Teunis
approach?}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{epilps} containing the pointwise and set
 estimates of the time-varying reproduction number and the epidemic curve
 respectively.
}
\description{
This routine estimates the instantaneous reproduction number Rt (the mean number
of secondary cases generated by an infectious individual at time t, White et
al. 2020) using Bayesian P-splines and Laplace approximations. The
\code{epilps()} routine estimates Rt based on a time series of incidence
counts and a given serial interval distribution. The negative
Binomial distribution is used to model incidence count data and P-splines
(Eilers and Marx, 1996) are used to smooth the epidemic curve. The link
between the epidemic curve and the reproduction number is established via the
renewal equation. If \code{incidence} contains NA values at certain time
points, these are replaced by the average of the left- and right neighbor
counts. If the right neighbor is NA, the left neighbor is used as a
replacement value.

si <- c(0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1)
epidemic <- episim(serial_interval = si, Rpattern = 2, endepi = 30)
epifit <- estimR(incidence = epidemic$y, si = si)
