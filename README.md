**EpiLPS** <span style="color: green;"> (Gressani et al. 2022)</span> is
an **Epi**demiological modeling tool using
**L**aplacian-**P**-**S**plines. It can be used to estimate (key)
epidemiological parameters such as the time-varying reproduction number
(the average number of secondary cases generated by an infected
individual), the incubation period of an infectious disease and the
serial interval. It can also be used for nowcasting. The website
associated to the project <https://epilps.com/> provides a detailed
documentation (or vignette) on how to use the underlying routines.
